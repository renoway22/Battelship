     * If you want to keep that behaviour, you can call super.placeShipsRandomly().
     * 
     * If you want to write your own ship placement procedure, these are the rules:
     * 1. You must place all the ships contained in the player's fleet's ship list. You can get this list by calling fleet.getShips().
     * 2. You must place every ship exactly once. You must not place any ship twice, or leave any ships unplaced.
     * 3. Ships may not overlap.
     * 4. Ships must be entirely within the playing field. To get the playing field's extents, get Settings.PLAYING_FIELD_HORIZONTAL_SIZE and Settings.PLAYING_FIELD_VERTICAL_SIZE. 
     *
     * Breaking any of these rules will throw an exception and abort the game.
     * 
     * To actually place a ship, call placeShip(Ship ship, Coordinates coordinates, int length, Orientation orientation).
     * To check whether a spot is free, call fleet.locationIsFree(Coordinates coordinates, int length, Orientation orientation).
